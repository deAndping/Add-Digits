The essence of this problem is that 10^n กิ 1 (mod 9), and thus a_n10^n + ... + a_110 + a_0 กิ a_n + ... + a_1 + a_0 (mod 9). This process can be continued until a number less than 9 is gotten, i.e. num % 9. For any digit n, n = n % 9 unless n = 9. The only confusing case is n % 9 = 0, but addDigits(num) = 0 if and only if num = 0, otherwise it should be 9 in fact.
